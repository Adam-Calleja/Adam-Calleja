### üë®‚Äçüíº About Me:

I'm a passionate 2nd-year student at the University of Manchester, studying Computer Science and Mathematics, with a deep enthusiasm for the dynamic worlds of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI). My journey into these fields began with an Extended Project Qualification focused on Machine Learning and an internship at the University of Cambridge, in collaboration with the Cambridge Open Zettascale Lab, where I focused on data analysis. 

My thirst for knowledge and the ever-evolving nature of these domains drive my persuit for an industrial placement opportunity that will not only broaden my skill set but also propel me into the fascinating realm of AI. My goal is not just to gather experience, but to engage in meaningful collaborations with diverse individuals, fostering an environment where innovation thrives.

### üìÑ Experience:

My prior role as a Data Science Intern at the University of Cambridge provided hands-on experience with extensive datasets. During the internship, I developed a Python framework to calculate the carbon footprint of 1000+ users' jobs on a Tier-2 National HPC Service. One standout experience involved optimizing a code tasked with identifying exclusive jobs on the supercomputer. While my initial implementation produced the desired results, it proved highly inefficient. To enhance efficiency, I explored two approaches: first, splitting the dataset into smaller chunks for serial processing across multiple cluster nodes; and second, parallelizing the code using the Python joblib library, fully utilizing available cores on my allocated node. The latter approach significantly reduced runtime and resource usage. In hindsight, I recognize the value of researching potential implementations before tackling such tasks, which would have provided better problem-solving insights and streamlined debugging and code optimization

As well as leading a two person group project as part of my internship with the Cambridge Open Zettascale Lab, I have had many opportunities to develop my leadership and interpersonal skills in academia. During my university's first-year team project, I successfully led a group of five in the development of a website. As the chair of our weekly meetings, I prioritized ensuring that every team member had an equal opportunity to contribute their ideas and actively encouraged participation. This provided our team with a wide variety of unique ideas, allowing for a more innovative approach to the project, ultimately leading to its successful completion.
