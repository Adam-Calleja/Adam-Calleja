### 👨‍💼 About Me:

I'm a passionate 2nd-year student at the University of Manchester, studying Computer Science and Mathematics, with a deep enthusiasm for the dynamic worlds of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI). My journey into these fields began with an Extended Project Qualification focused on Machine Learning and an internship at the University of Cambridge, in collaboration with the Cambridge Open Zettascale Lab, where I focused on data analysis. 

My thirst for knowledge and the ever-evolving nature of these domains drive my persuit for an industrial placement opportunity that will not only broaden my skill set but also propel me into the fascinating realm of AI. My goal is not just to gather experience, but to engage in meaningful collaborations with diverse individuals, fostering an environment where innovation thrives.
